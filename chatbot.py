1. Provide all the information to potential tenants about the units available with a higher priority on the one they applied to
2. Retrieve all the information about the potential tenants by asking them questions or extracting it from their messages
3. Get the potential tenants to come visit the apartment
4. Optimize the visits in order to minimize the impact for the owner
